# Medal-Analysis


🥇 Olympic Medals Analysis with Python

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Olympic medals by country. It uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to clean data, generate metrics, and produce visualizations that show trends within the historical medal table.

📁 Project Description

The purpose of the analysis is to answer key questions such as:

Which countries win the most gold medals?

Which countries accumulate more than 10 total medals?

Which ones have historically dominated the medal table?

How is performance distributed among countries?

How do Gold / Silver / Bronze compare among the strongest?

The project serves as a practical example for a portfolio aimed at a Data Analyst or Junior Data Scientist.
